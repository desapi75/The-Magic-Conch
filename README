The Magic Conch Philosiphy 

This Project is intented to be built with the UNIX philosiphy. This means that
this project should be broken up into many small uncoupled parts to prevent
complication. This will also allow more ease amongst the opensource community
in modifying the project. This project should be built with the intention that
users with very little programming experience can modify the program to suite
their needs. No single part is going to make the program run well but instead
many small parts working together. Some parts may seem trivial and useless but
in fact when combined with other parts add a whole new layer of posibilities
to the project.
